# Diabetics Prediction Using KNN in Python 

<h3>Overview </h3>
This project utilizes machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on relevant health indicators. The core algorithm employs K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to analyze patterns in the dataset and make predictions. The user-friendly front end is powered by Flask, providing a seamless interface for users to input their health data and receive predictions.

<h3>Features</h3>
1)K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm: Utilizes the KNN algorithm to classify diabetes likelihood based on input features.
